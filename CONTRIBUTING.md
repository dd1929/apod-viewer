# Contributing to APOD Viewer

First up, thanks a lot for willing to come here to look at how to contribute!

This project is really small at the moment though, so there's not many ways in which you can contribute. But in the few ways you can, you can contribute a lot!

## Reporting issues

You might find a bug here or there. Maybe notifications aren't working. Or the app isn't opening. Or something else. File an issue here then: https://github.com/dd1929/apod-viewer/issues.

Before filing an issue, however, make sure there doesn't exist another issue about the same problem. Only file an issue when you are sure that it hasn't been filed already.
